** Simple citations
*** Parenthetical 
Some great ideas occur in books [@Brandom1994]. Others in articles
[@Hofweber2007]. Still others are in collections of previously
published work [@Russell1919], or in conference proceedings
[@Rogers1996]; sometimes they are the proceedings themselves
[@RogersKepser2007].  Sometimes, a great idea can be found in a
dissertation [@Caponigro2003], and sometimes on just a handout
[@Ross1985].  Some remain forever unpublished [@Faraci1970].

*** In-text 
Some great ideas occur in books, such as @Brandom1994. Others in
articles, such as @Hofweber2007. Still others are in collections of
previously published work, such as @Russell1919, or in conference
proceedings like @Rogers1996; sometimes they are the proceedings
themselves such as @RogersKepser2007.  Sometimes, a great idea can be
found in a dissertation, such as @Caponigro2003, and sometimes on just
a handout like @Ross1985.  Some remain forever unpublished, such as
@Faraci1970.

*** With prefix and suffix data
Some great ideas occur in books [(cite): see @Brandom1994 chapter 7]. 
Others in articles [(cite): @Hofweber2007 section 1]. Still others
are in collections of previously published work, such as 
[cite: @Russell1919 cf. section 3], or in conference proceedings 
[(cite): e.g., @Rogers1996].  Sometimes, a great idea can be found in a
dissertation, like an idea by [cite: see @Caponigro2003 chapter 1],
and sometimes on just a handout, like others by [cite: e.g., @Ross1985].

*** Citations to works with tricky field data
In some cases, the authors have names which are tricky to represent in
BibTeX, like @BelnapSteel1976, or @Vaanaanen2011.
@denDikkenMeinungerWilder2000 has a lead author that should probably
be capitalized in sentence-initial position. Sometimes, it's the
journal name which is difficult [@Belnap1970].
